# distract-google-tracking
A python script that generates random traffic in an attempt to distract google advertising

After loading yahoo, the script collects the available links of that page. It will then randomly select one of those links and open it in a new tab. Further expansion could include:
- automatically starting the script when the machine is not being used (like a screensaver)
- more diversified links to select from 

Note: the url can be changed, pick a website with a variety of links
