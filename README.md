# distract-google-tracking
A python script that generates random traffic to distract google advertising

By loading yahoo or google trends, the script collects the available links. It will then randomly select one and open it in a new tab. We are hoping to expand this program so that:
- this program can run when the machine is not being used
- expand the program so that there would be more available and diversified links to select from
