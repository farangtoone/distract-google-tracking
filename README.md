# distract-google-tracking
A python script that generates random traffic to distract google advertising

By loading yahoo or google trends, the script collects the available links of that page. It will then randomly select one of those links and open it in a new tab. Further expansion could include:
- the program needs to verify the link before opening it (now it's limited to an average of 1 to 5 pages)
- automatically starting the script when the machine is not being used (like a screensaver)
- more diversified links to select from
