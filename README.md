# distract-google-tracking
A python script that explores the possibilities of generating random traffic in an attempt to distract google advertising.

After loading yahoo's homepage as initial reference, the script collects the available links and randomly selects one of those links to open in a new tab. Due to the script picking up all links (css or js files too) and changes in Google's algorithm, the script doesn't run as smooth as before.
